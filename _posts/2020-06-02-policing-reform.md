# Police Reform in Your Back Yard

I'm hoping to engage in some NIMBYism. In all the ways that systemic racism can harm, perhaps the most visible form is in police-citizen interactions. The problems are many and deep. Most policing is controlled at the local level, a city or county government, elected Sheriff, or elected Police Commissioner. Police can he held accountable by a local prosecutor, typically elected. In the City of Falls Church in Virginia, the structures I'm aware of are:

* City Police: The police are part of the city government. 
* City Council: Ultimately controls the entire city government including budgets and direct oversight of the police.
* Sheriff: Locally elected individual who controls a small force of Sheriff deputies.
* Commonwealth's Attorney: Locally (shared with Arlington) elected prosecutor who chooses what sort of cases to pursue and invest resources into, including cases brought against officers.
