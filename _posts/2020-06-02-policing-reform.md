# Police Reform in Your Back Yard

_Disclaimer: I'm not an expert in policing and local laws. I'm not part of a marginalized community to fully understand the impact of unjust policing. I am a concerned citizen trying to identify how I can advocate in my own community to continue the hard work of fixing a broken system._

I'm hoping to engage in some NIMBYism. In all the ways that systemic racism can harm, perhaps the most visible form is in police-citizen interactions. The problems are many and deep. Most policing is controlled at the local level, a city or county government, elected Sheriff, or elected Police Commissioner. Police can he held accountable by a local prosecutor, typically elected. In the City of Falls Church in Virginia, the structures I'm aware of are:

* City Police: The police are part of the city government. 
* City Council: Ultimately controls the entire city government including budgets and direct oversight of the police.
* Sheriff: Locally elected individual who controls a small force of Sheriff deputies.
* Commonwealth's Attorney: Locally (shared with Arlington) elected prosecutor who chooses what sort of cases to pursue and invest resources into, including cases brought against officers.

## Specific Actions 

Here's what might be done based on my understanding of the authority at different levels. 

1. _Uniforms:_ The police in our quiet little town have quasi-military uniforms. Most wear navy-blue cargo pants and an external kevlar vest. The K-9 officer wears a similar but green (more military in appearance) uniform with MOLLE straps. I do question the necessity of this sort of gear as opposed to the more classic "professional" police uniforms and shoes, perhaps with kevlar worn under the shirt. It may sound petty, but it sets a tone and is easy to fix.

2. _Body Cameras:_ I honestly am not sure the state of if and how body cameras are used in our city. I'm also not sure what the best practice benchmark is regarding policies around those cameras. 

3. _Training:_ I've never been an officer, and I can imagine how hard it is to remain calm and ensure justice in a fast-moving, possibly threatening situation. Training on de-escalation and related techniques helps set up the officers for success. I don't know how our city stacks up in how we support the officers.

4. _Regional Support:_ I understand that many local law enforcement organizations have mutual aid agreements so they can support each other during overwhelming events. For example, Arlington police were called in to help with protest crowd control in DC. I'd think these agreements are generally a good thing. However, it may be worth refining the policy for what types of actions we are willing to support. For example, I would not want our police force to be part of aggressive "clearing" of protests.

5. _Police Prosecution:_ When officers overstep, it is important they are held accountable through a fair legal process. I understand that the Commonwealth's Attorney can unilaterally choose to pursue such cases and invest resources into building and prosecuting such cases. 

6. _Minor Crime Prosecution:_ Minority groups are more likely to be arrested for minor offenses. The Commonwealth's Attorney can choose to de-emphasize bringing such arrests to prosecution. This could de-incentivize police to make such arrests, and thus result in less singling out of minorities.

7. _Measurement:_ I don't know how various policing activities are recorded, tracked, or measured. We should look at best practices for what sort of data helps to track progress and hold the city accountable.

## Path Forward

My uneducated opinion isn't enough, and a citizen task force could help to research and recommend more specific actions. I recommend that the City Council appoint such a group. The group could call on experts, such as local reps from the ACLU, Black Lives Matter, Police Unions, etc. Based on this research, the task force would create and publish a list of recommended actions for the City Council, Police, Sheriff, Commonwealth's Attorney, and state/federal representatives. 

Some of the solutions may be political, and that may not be appropriate under the purview of a city task force. An alternative or 2nd structure may make sense under the auspices of either self-organized citizens, a community group, or a local university.
