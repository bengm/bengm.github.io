title: Teaching my 4yr old Ruby
excerpt: I am learning Ruby. When I saw KidsRuby, I thought it would be fun to see how a pre-reader can handle code, and my 4 year old daughter and I have played with it for a couple evenings now.

<div class="post_body"><p><br>I am learning Ruby. When I saw <a href="http://kidsruby.com/">KidsRuby</a>, I thought it would be fun to see how a pre-reader can handle code, and my 4 year old daughter and I have played with it for a couple evenings now.&nbsp;</p>
<p>KidsRuby has a standard text output interface, but the real draw is the Turtle graphics. You can tell it to go forward a number of steps, turn right or left a number of degrees, set some colors, etc.</p>
<p>My daughter can't really read yet. I walked her through it. I'd ask questions like "How far should it go? Should it turn right or left? What color should the line be?". I would type in most of the code, leaving her to key in a number or two and click the 'run' button. The result of our first session is below.</p>

<p>When she was done, it was my turn. I set up a basic algorithm to loop through a series of turns. There is some magic in making a computer draw, at an animal-brain level. The gallery below has a series of images generated from the same algorithm, just tweaking parameters.</p>

<p>Here is the code that generated the few images:</p>

<p>Maybe I'll try to replicate this in the HTML5 world as a learning exercise.</p>
