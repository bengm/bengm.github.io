title: Going Paperless
excerpt: iPad + Apple pencil isn't perfect, but it's been good enough to replace most of my paper note-taking. I've stuck with it for about 7 months now, which is enough to declare victory.

## Paperless for 7 months

About 7 months ago, I got an iPad pro with the Apple Pencil and the GoodNotes app. There are some tradeoffs, but it has been a net success. I've stopped using paper for most of my note taking and the like. My usage falls into a few patterns:

 * __Notes__: Meeting notes and the like
 * __Document Reviews__: Reviewing and taking notes on a document (but not editing/redlining a doc - for that, I just do it on a laptop in MS Word)
 * __Sketching__: Not like an artist, but like a consultant or IT architect - i.e. drawing diagrams

I even created a mind map of the tradeoffs of my approach using the iPad...

## The Technology

The set of tools I've used with approximate prices are:

 * 9.7" iPad pro ($800)
 * Apple Pencil ($100)
 * iPad standard folding case ($40)
 * Pencil pouch ($10)
 * GoodNotes app ($8)
 * Box.com (on corporate plan, but free options exist - also alternatives like Dropbox should do just as well)
 * Quicktime (if you want to share your iPad screen on a web meeting or whatnot and draw live whiteboard-style, you can plug in the iPad to the mac, open quicktime, and do new recording selecting the iPad - sounds involved, but pretty simple in practice)

## The Good

* The basics work - writing feels pretty natural and better than an old-school stylus.
* The colors - I can easily switch pen color, weight, etc., plus other things like snapping to shapes (drawing a smooth circle or straight line)
* Undo - I make lots of mistakes, undo or erase are easier than pencil/paper.
* Move - I misjudge the page. I can move content around the page to make space where I need it.
* Markup - for doc reviews, the highlight and margin notes work well... at least as good as paper.
* Handwriting recognition - I don't have great penmanship, but the app seems to do well to make my handwriting searchable. (Searching within the GoodNotes app could use some work though.)
* PDF backup - GoodNotes integrates with Box.com (and other similar tools). It creates PDF versions of all my notebooks automagically. I can then easily pull those up on my computer and search the contents of the files in other tools (e.g. Box.com mobile app).
* Box integration - I can pull docs from Box.com for markup. I sometimes use this for custom page templates for note taking.

## The Bad

* It ain't paper - Apple Pencil is a better stylus, but not quite revolutionary. The friction of a good pencil or pen on paper is a lot different.
* Handwriting - My handwriting is not fantastic. In some circumstances, my writing is a bit better with normal paper. With the iPad, at least I can undo.
* Nerdiness - I feel like a bit of a nerd (and not in the good way) using an iPad to take meeting notes. It feels a little like when I got a Palm Pilot way back and wore it in a belt holster. Seemed like a good idea on paper, but not in real life.
* Size - I opted for the standard 9.7" iPad instead of the 13". _(My reasoning was a bit circular: I already have a 13" laptop; if I get a 13" tablet to go in the bag next to it, that's a bit silly; I might as well get a single device like a MS Surface; but I don't like the Windows UI. Maybe the next next macbook has the hinge-back touchscreen like some PCs do.)_ This is a little limiting for freeform notes, but not too bad. Lots of zoom in/out, which is actually pretty natural. It is more limiting for reading and annotating a document where the bigger screen would allow me to see the doc in approximately 8.5"x11" actual size.

## The Bottom Line

It's a tradeoff, but paper is losing. I've gone for 7+ months and haven't seriously considered going back. My notes are organized and colorful. I sometimes look like a dork. I carry a second screen around in my bag, but it probably doesn't weigh more than a Moleskine with a couple fancy pens. $1000 for a notepad solution is a bit crazy, but it has some other benefits and uses.
